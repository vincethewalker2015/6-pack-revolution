  <p class="pages-text">Avocados, which are actually classified as a fruit, are low in fructose and rich in healthy 
  monounsaturated fat and potassium, and research has confirmed the avocado's ability to benefit 
  vascular function and heart health. <br />Avocados are also very high in potassium 
  (more than twice the amount found in a banana) and will help balance your vitally 
  important potassium-to-sodium ratio. Avocados also provide close to 20 essential 
  health-boosting nutrients, including fiber, vitamin E, B-vitamins, and folic acid. 
  Besides eating them raw, you can use avocado as a fat substitute in recipes calling for 
  butter or other oils. <br />Another boon of avocadosâ€”they're one of the safest fruits you can 
  buy conventionally grown, so you don't need to spend more for organic ones. 
  Their thick skin protects the inner fruit from pesticides.</p>
